The weather prediction model for Australia utilizes the Random Forest algorithm to forecast whether it will rain the next day. Leveraging historical weather data from various regions across Australia, the model undergoes extensive preprocessing, including data cleaning and feature engineering, to ensure its reliability and accuracy. Features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure are carefully selected and processed to capture the complex relationships influencing rainfall patterns.
